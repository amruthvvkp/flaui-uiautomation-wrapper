# MkDocs Documentation Guidelines

- All documentation should be written in Markdown and placed in the `docs/` folder.
- The documentation must include:
  - An **Introduction** page describing the project, its goals, and background.
  - A **Motivation** page explaining why this library was created, its advantages over alternatives (e.g., RobotFlaUI), and its unique features.
  - A **Contributing** page with clear instructions for contributing, including code standards, mapping conventions, and testing requirements.
- Use code blocks, lists, and headings for clarity.
- Reference the repository's Copilot instructions and prompt files for standards and examples.
- Ensure all new features and changes are documented.
- Keep documentation up to date with codebase changes.
