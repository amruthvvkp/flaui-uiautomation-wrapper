# Create MkDocs Documentation Pages

This prompt helps you create documentation for the FlaUI Python port using MkDocs. The documentation should be placed in the `docs/` folder and follow repository standards.

## Instructions

- Write a **Motivation** page explaining why this library was created, its advantages over alternatives (e.g., RobotFlaUI), and its unique features.
- Write a **Contributing** page with clear instructions for contributing, including code standards, mapping conventions, and testing requirements.
- Use Markdown formatting, headings, lists, and code blocks for clarity.
- Reference repository Copilot instructions and prompt files for standards and examples.
- Ensure documentation is clear, concise, and up to date.

## Example Structure

- `docs/index.md` (Introduction)
- `docs/motivation.md` (Motivation)
- `docs/contributing.md` (Contributing)

## Output

- Provide the full Markdown content for each page, ready to be added to the `docs/` folder.
- Add a short summary of the documentation structure if needed.
