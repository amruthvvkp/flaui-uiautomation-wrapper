"""Integration tests for external Windows applications."""

# Integration tests are for testing against real Windows applications
# like Calculator, Notepad, WordPad, etc.
#
# These tests may be flaky depending on:
# - Windows version (10, 11, etc.)
# - Application versions
# - System language/locale
# - UI automation permissions
#
# Run locally or in CI with caution.
