# Introduction

Welcome to the FlaUI Python port documentation! This library provides a 1:1 mapping of the FlaUI C# API for Windows UI automation, making it fully accessible to Python developers. Unlike RobotFlaUI, which is limited to Robot Framework and XPath, this project aims for complete feature parity and plug-and-play usage for Python automation.

## What is FlaUI?

FlaUI is a C# library for UI test automation on Windows, supporting both UIA2 and UIA3. It enables robust automation of WinForms, WPF, and other Windows applications.

## Why a Python Port?

The Python ecosystem lacked a comprehensive UI automation library with the capabilities of FlaUI. This project bridges that gap, allowing Python developers to leverage the full power of FlaUI using PythonNet for C# interop, with Pydantic models for validation and type safety.

## Key Features

- Full mapping of C# endpoints to Python
- Support for WinForms and WPF test applications
- Plug-and-play usage with all required C# binaries included
- PyTest-based unit and UI tests
- Extensible for other test frameworks
